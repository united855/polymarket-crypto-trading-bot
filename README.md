## Strategy Summaries

### 1. 15-Minute Dump and Hedge Bot (CURRENT)

> **This is the bot included in this repository.**

Monitors 15-minute Up/Down markets and detects sudden price drops ("dumps"). When one side's ask price drops sharply (e.g. 15%+ in 3 seconds), the bot buys that side immediately. It then waits for the opposite side to become cheap enough that the combined cost is below a target (e.g. $0.95). If both legs fill, you hold both outcomes for under $1, guaranteeing profit at resolution ($1 payout). If the hedge doesn't come in time, a stop-loss kicks in.

**Key parameters:** dump threshold, hedge sum target, lookback window, stop-loss timing.

> **Strategy credit:** Based on [The Smart Ape's](https://x.com/the_smart_ape) two-leg catching-and-hedging strategy for Polymarket BTC 15-minute UP/DOWN markets ([original tweet](https://x.com/the_smart_ape/status/2005576087875527082) · [detailed write-up on Lookonchain](https://www.lookonchain.com/articles/1209)). The Smart Ape's approach — detect a sharp dump on one side, buy it, then hedge by buying the opposite side when the combined cost is below $1 — achieved ~86% ROI in backtesting. This bot is a Rust implementation of that core idea with added stop-loss management, multi-asset support, and automatic redemption.

### 2. 15-Minute Pre-Order and Mid-Market Bot

Places limit BUY orders for **both Up and Down** at a low price (e.g. $0.45 each) before the next 15-minute period starts. If both fill, total cost < $1 and profit is locked in. Also places mid-market orders in the current period using dynamic pricing derived from live sell prices. Signal-based filters skip orders when the market is already one-sided.

**Key parameters:** price limit, signal stable range, sell-opposite timing, danger price.

**Real Results:**

### 3. 1-Hour Pre-Limit Order Bot

Targets 1-hour Up/Down markets. Places limit BUY orders on both sides at a fixed price before the next hour begins. When both sides fill, positions are **merged** (redeemed back to USDC) to lock in profit immediately without waiting for market resolution. Danger and timeout exits protect against one-sided fills.

**Key parameters:** price limit, merge logic, danger price, timeout.

**Real Results:**

### 4. 1-Hour Pre-Limit Order and Mid-Market Bot

Extends the 1-hour pre-limit strategy with **dynamic mid-market orders** during the current hour. The cheaper side is bought at its current sell price; the opposite side gets a small discount. Combined with pre-orders for the next hour, this maximizes fill opportunities. Same merge and risk management as the pre-limit bot.

**Key parameters:** price limit, opposite-side discount, mid-market enabled, signal.

**Real Results:**

### 5. 5-Minute Pre-Order and Mid-Market Bot

Same concept as the 15-minute pre-order bot, adapted for the faster 5-minute markets. Places limit buys on both sides at low prices before the next period. The 5-minute timeframe means thinner liquidity and more frequent opportunities, but also requires faster signal evaluation and tighter risk management.

**Key parameters:** price limit, sell-opposite threshold and timing (in seconds), signal range.

**Real Results:**

### 6. 5-Minute High-Side Buy Bot

When one side is strongly favored (bid >= 90c+) late in a 5-minute period, the bot buys that side — betting the market consensus is right with limited time to reverse. If the price drops below a floor, the bot sells or hedges with the opposite side. Per-asset configuration allows different thresholds and behaviors.

**Key parameters:** threshold, after seconds, sell-under price, hedge (opposite) enabled.

**Real Results:**

### 7. 5-Minute Low-Side Buy Bot

Places limit buys at very low prices (1c, 2c, 3c) on **both** Up and Down. Each fill is a cheap lottery ticket: risk 1-3c to potentially make 97-99c if that side wins. Take-profit tiers (e.g. sell 50% at 10c, rest at 15c) lock in multi-x returns even without holding to expiry. Unfilled orders are automatically cancelled near market close.

**Key parameters:** entry prices, take-profit tiers, cancel-unfilled timing.

**Real Results:**

## Current Bot: 15-Minute Dump and Hedge

This repository contains the **15-Minute Dump-and-Hedge Bot**. Below is everything you need to get it running.

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** (e.g. 1.70+): install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)
- **Polymarket account** and API credentials (for production)
- **Proxy wallet** and **private key** (for signing and redeeming)

### Configuration

Configuration is in **`config.json`** (path overridable with `--config`).

```json
{
 ....
}
```

### Build & Run

```bash
cargo build --release
```

**Simulation (no real orders):**

```bash
./target/release/polymarket-arbitrage-bot --simulation
```

**Production (live trading):**

```bash
./target/release/polymarket-arbitrage-bot --production --config config.json
```

### Redeem Mode

After a 15m market resolves, redeem winning positions:

```bash
./target/release/polymarket-arbitrage-bot --redeem --config config.json
```

Redeem a specific condition:

```bash
./target/release/polymarket-arbitrage-bot --redeem --condition-id 0x... --config config.json
```

### Running with PM2

```javascript
// ecosystem.config.cjs
module.exports = {
  apps: [{
    name: "polymarket-bot",
    script: "./target/release/polymarket-arbitrage-bot",
    args: "--production --config config.json",
    cwd: __dirname,
    interpreter: "none",
    autorestart: true,
    watch: false,
    max_memory_restart: "500M",
  }],
};
```

```bash
pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs
pm2 logs polymarket-bot
```

### Logging

- **Stderr:** Main log stream (info level).
- **`history.toml`:** Append-only run log in the working directory.
- **RUST_LOG:** `RUST_LOG=info` (default) or `RUST_LOG=debug` for more detail.

### Supported Markets

Configured via `trading.markets` in `config.json`:

- `btc` — Bitcoin 15m Up/Down
- `eth` — Ethereum 15m Up/Down

- `xrp` — XRP 15m Up/Down

### Security

- **Never commit real keys.** Keep `config.json` out of version control.
- **`private_key`** controls funds; restrict file permissions and use a dedicated trading wallet.
